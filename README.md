# Prospect Park Bicycle Solution
* By Mark Torrey


## Notes 
* It's simple really: use cobblestones in the drive and pedestrian lanes where there is a pedestrian crossing to keep bicycles from riding over those lanes at high speed. At the same time, keep asphault in the middle lane so a cautious cyclist can maintain speed through the gap if there is no one crossing.
